== Build tools
	
In software development the term _building_ usually means the conversion of source code and other artifacts, like images or configuration files, into another artifact. 
For example source code might be compiled into a JAR file, or you may create a new standalone application.
The build result can be shared with users of the software or used only internally.

A _build tool_ is used to automate repetitive tasks during this process. 
This can be, for example, compiling source code, running software tests and creating files and documentation for the software deployment.
	
Build tools typically run without a graphical user interface directly from the command line. As a user interface is not required for such builds, these builds are called _headless_.
	
Popular build tools in the Java space are _Maven_, _Gradle_ and _Apache Ant_.
