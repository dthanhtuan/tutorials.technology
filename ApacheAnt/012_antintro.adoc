=== What is Apache Ant?

_Apache Ant_ (Ant) is a general purpose build tool. Ant is an abbreviation for _Another Neat Tool_.

Ant is primarily used for building and deploying Java projects but can be used for every possible repetitive tasks, e.g. generating documentation.

=== Configuring Apache Ant

A Java build process typically includes:

* the compilation of the Java source code into Java bytecode
* creation of the .jar file for the distribution of the code
* creation of the Javadoc documentation

Ant uses an `xml` file for its configuration. 
The default file name is `build.xml`.
Ant builds are based on three blocks: _tasks_, _targets_ and _extension points_.

A task is a unit of work which should be performed and constitutes of small atomic steps, for example compile source code or create Javadoc.
Tasks can be grouped into targets.

A target can be directly invoked via Ant.
Targets can specify their dependencies.
Ant will automatically execute all dependent targets.

For example if target A depends on B and Ant is instructed to run A, it first runs B before running A.

In your `build.xml` file you can specify the default target.
Ant executes this target, if no explicit target is specified.
