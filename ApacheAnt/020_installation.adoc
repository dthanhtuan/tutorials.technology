=== Prerequisites

Ant requires the installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
See https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaIntroduction/article.html[Java introduction] for a description how to install Java.

[[installation_ubuntu]]
=== Ubuntu

On Ubuntu use the `apt-get install ant` command to install Ant.
For other distributions please check the documentation of your vendor.

[[installation_windows]]
=== Windows

Download Apache Ant from http://ant.apache.org/.

Extract the zip file into a directory structure of your choice.
Set the `ANT_HOME` environment variable to this location and include the `ANT_HOME/bin` directory in your path.

Make also sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the JDK. 
This is required for running _Ant_.

Check your installation by opening a command line and typing `ant -version` into the commend line. 
The system should find the command ant and show the version number of your installed _Ant_ version.
