== Apache Hadoop
[[overview]]
=== Overview

Apache Hadoop is a software solution for distributed computing of large datasets. 
Hadoop provides a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/MapReduce/article.html[MapReduce] implementation.

A special computer acts as the "name node". 
This computer saves the information about the available clients and the files. 
The Hadoop clients (computers) are called nodes. 
The "name node" is currently a single point of failure. 
The Hadoop project is working on solutions for this. 

[[tasks]]
=== Typical tasks

Apache Hadoop can be used to filter and aggregate data, e.g. a typical use case would be the analysis of web server log files to find the most visited pages.
But MapReduce has been used to transverse the graphs and other tasks.

[[functions]]
=== Writing the map and reduce functions

Hadoop allows that the map and reduce functions are written in Java.
Hadoop provides also linker so that map and reduce functions can be written in other languages, e.g. C++, Python, Pe, etc.
