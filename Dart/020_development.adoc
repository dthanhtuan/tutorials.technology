== Development

To develop and run a _Dart_ application you typically only need the SDK on your Path and a text editor.
Such tools are https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] or https://atom.io/[Atom].

=== Running a Dart application

Running a _Dart_ program simply needs a file with a `main()` method.
This file can then be executed using the _Dart_ compiler via `$ dart path-to-file.dart`.
The compiler will automatically pick up the `main()` method and execute it.

=== Packaging / Building for production

To bundle your application _Dart_ uses so called "snapshots".
It bundles all files in your project into an executable binary file.
The _Dart SDK_ can then execute the file.

Creating a snapshot:
[source, console]
----
$ dart --snapshot=<your-snapshot-name> <your-main-file>
----

Then run the created snapshot:
[source, console]
----
$ dart <your-snapshot-name>
----
