== Fedora

Fedora is a community driven Linux distribution backed by RedHat.

The project has a reputation to adopt new technologies early and for working closely together with upstream communities.

The default desktop environment is gnome.
There are other alternatives (called spins) available like KDE, XFCE or Cinnamon.
