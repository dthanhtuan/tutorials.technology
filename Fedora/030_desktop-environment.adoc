== Desktop Environment

The default desktop environment is https://www.gnome.org/[Gnome].

There are other alternatives in the official repositories available:

- XFCE
- KDE Plasma
- Cinnamon
- Mate
- LXQT
- LXDE

If you prefer one of them over Gnome they can be installed using the package manager.
Although it might make sense for you to directly install a spin that has the desired environment by default.
They are called spins and are available on the https://spins.fedoraproject.org/[official Fedora spins website].
