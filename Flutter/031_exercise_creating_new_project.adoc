== Exercise: Creating a new project

Currently there are 3 different ways of developing Flutter applications:

1. Visual Studio Code (or *VSCode* for short)
2. Android Studio (or any other JetBrains IDE)
3. A TextEditor and a Terminal

NOTE: This tutorial will use Visual Studio Code for development

=== Creating the project

Open VSCode and invoke the command palette via (menu:View[Command Palette...] or button:[Ctrl + Shift + P]).

1. Select **Flutter: New Project**.
2. Enter a name for your project.
3. Select a folder where the project should be saved.

VSCode will now restart after it restarted it will run the actual creation of template code.
This will create the `hello_world` project.

Your explorer on the left should look similar to this:

NOTE: If the project is not automatically created, make sure the `Dart` and `Flutter` extensions are enabled.

=== Starting the application

On the right side of the status bar at the bottom of VSCode you should see multiple information about your development environment.
One of these indicators shows the current status of the target device (or emulator):

If you set up an emulator or your physical device earlier you can click on the btn:[No Devices] button.
A pop up will open that lets you chose which device you want to develop on.
The list contains the emulators as well as any ADB enabled device your PC has access to.

Choose one of the listed devices.
If the target device is an emulator wait for it to fully start.

Press kbd:[F5] to start the application.

The build process is now started.

NOTE: Depending on your internet connection and host device speed the initial build could take several minutes.
You can see the current step/progress in the builtin _DEBUG CONSOLE_ of VSCode.
If it did not open automatically you can open it using the command `Debug: Focus on Debug Console View`

After the build process finished the app should now appear on your target device:

image:hello_world__running_app.png[Hello World - Running Application]

Tap 3 times on the btn:[+] in the bottom right.

Now go ahead and change 

[source, dart]
----
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
----

to

[source, dart]
----
        primarySwatch: Colors.red,
----

on line 12 of the generated code.

When saving the change should automatically show up in the running app.
Notice how the number of times you clicked the button stayed the same.
This a feature of the Flutter toolkit that allows state to be persisted between hot reloads.

You can trigger a hot reload manually by using the respective button in the debug toolkit at the top of you VSCode instance:
