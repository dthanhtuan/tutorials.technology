You require a valid Gerrit user to work with Gerrit.
In your test installation, you create your own users.

In a Gerrit installation in which you are not the administrator, you ask the administrator to create a user for you.
====

Login to your Gerrit installation. 
Assuming that you installed it on your local machine using the default values, you can access it via the following URL: 

....
http://localhost:8080/login/

The first user to login automatically gets the administrator status.
