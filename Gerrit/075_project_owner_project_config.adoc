== Project Owner: Editing the project config through Git

Each Gerrit project is configured via a project configuration file.
You can edit the project configuration via the webuser interface, under menu:Browse[Projects].

It is possible to edit this directly.
The config files are store in the projects Git repository.
They reside in the special branch `refs/meta/config`.
To check them out issue the following commands on your terminal:

[source, terminal]
----
git remote add gerrit ssh://<gerrit-site>:<gerrit-port>
git fetch gerrit refs/meta/config:refs/remotes/gerrithub/meta/config
git checkout gerrithub/meta/config
----

Your project specific rules are in the file `project.config`.
The file follows the Git configuration format.

Assuming your project is lacking the "Verified" label you could add the following to the config:

[source, git_config]
----
[label "Verified"]
       function = MaxWithBlock
       value = -1 Fails
       value =  0 No score
       value = +1 Verified
----

After you have commited your changes you can push them:

[source, terminal]
----
git push -f gerrithub  HEAD:refs/meta/config
----

[[managing_project_access]]
== Project Owner: Managing project access

Project access in Gerrit is generally handled through Groups, although you can also set permissions on a per user basis.
An open source project might have a group for commiters, who can review and merge changes, and a group for their CI solutions.
To create a new group navigate to menu:Browse[Groups > CREATE NEW].

Once you have created a group you are taken to the group management page, where you can add new members to the group.

After that you can give this Group access to your project.
This is done either through the web interface at menu:Browse[Projects > Your Project > Access] or by editing the projects config file as described in <<editing_project_config_git>>.
