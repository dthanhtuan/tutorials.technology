=== Remove a bad commit from a series of commits

If you create a series of dependent commits, it might happen that
one of the commits is rejected during the review process.

In this case, you cannot merge the  other commits as they still have a dependency to the "bad" commit.

During the review process commit 2 are rejected.
The commit 3 and commit 4 are still good and do not depend on the changes in commit 2.

The solution is to use interactive rebase to skip the bad commit.

[TIP]
====
The Gerrit user interface does show "depends on" and "needed by" fields when it knows that a Gerrit review depends on another review. 
This helps you manage your dependency trail.
