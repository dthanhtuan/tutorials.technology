== Things to consider if you want to contribute to an existing project

[[contribution_whattofix]]
=== How to start contributing?

It is typically a good approach to fix something really simple
as the
first
step. Search for a few warning messages
in the code, or a
typo
in the
documentation, and prepare a fix for it.

Once you get familiar with the contribution process start
contributing something more difficult.

[[contribution_scope]]
=== Scope of a Gerrit change / commit

A Gerrit change (== one commit) should address only one issue.

Avoid going "off topic" with your patches. If you would like to
clean up some code, or fix something out of the
scope of your patch,
create additional patches. This will make your patches
more
concise,
easier to review and
easier to
revert if something go wrong.

In many open source projects smaller patches tend to be reviewed
faster
and merged faster as it is easier for the
committer to
review.
With this in mind, try to break your contributions into small
concise
Gerrit changes. It is more
likely that these get reviewed and
accepted.

It also helps to reach a clean history. Imagine you are chasing
a bug in code which was introduced 2 years back.
If the history is
built from small concise commits, it is easier to find the commit
which introduced the problem and
understand the motivation why it was
done in the way it was implemented.

[[contribution_commitmessagegerrit]]
=== Commit message

Most project handles the required commit message a bit
differently. For example, the Eclipse Platform project
prefers the
following
format:

[source,java]
----
include::res/commitmessage/header.txt[]
----

The text in the header must match the title in Bugzilla. The Eclipse Git tooling complains about commit headers
longer than 80, but
you can ignore this warning. For
example the following is a valid commit message for
the Eclipse
platform project. The
description in the body of the commit message
can take as
many lines as necessary and
should be
descriptive of what
is
going
into the patch. For more complex patches you should provide
implementation
details and enough
notes to allow the
reviewer to
understand what your fix provides.

[source,text]
----
include::res/commitmessage/example.txt[]
----

It is important to explain in the commit body, why the change
was done. Also explain why you have chosen a
certain
implementation method, if there was something special about it.

TIP: Don't worry too much about the correct commit message format,
the project you
are contributing to will also
review your commit
message.

[[contribution_copyrightheader]]
=== Copyright header update

In some projects the source file contains a copyright header. If you modify the
file you should also update the
copyright header. Different project might use different standards here. Have a look at existing commits and the
header in the
existing files and try to adapt the style preferred by the existing developers.

[[contribution_copyrightheader_platformui]]
=== Example: Copyright header in Eclipse Platform UI

Most Eclipse projects to not required to update the copyright header.
Optionally you can also add yourself to the copyright with a reference to the bug and update the copyright header with the last modified year.
The following listing shows an example for this standard.

[source,text]
----
include::res/copyright/header.txt[]
----

The above file was created in 2008 and last modified in 2015. It
was
originally created by employees of IBM and
also
modified by John
Doe
and he fixed Bug 429728 with it. The additional entry in the
_Contributors_
section is
typically considered
optional, but this depends on the
individual project.

If you work for an organization the Foundation recommends
adding the
organization name in parentheses. See:
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php[Copyright info from eclipse.org].
For example:`John Doe (vogella GmbH) John.Doe@fake.com - Bug 429728 - Fixed compiler warnings`

If you add a new file don't forget to add the copyright header
using the project's license. For new files, list
"yourself and
others"
instead of "IBM and
others" in the first line.

If you fix several bugs in the same file, you should list the
bug separately as in the following example listing.
In case you find
yourself changing the same file over
and over again, you could also
use "ongoing maintenance" instead
of
listing every bug number.

[source,text]
----
include::res/copyright/header2.txt[]
----

In most cases you should avoid putting in the bug number into
the source code (except the header). Only if you
have to implement a
workaround for an existing bug, you should add a reference in the
source to this bug.

[[contribution_polite]]
=== Stay polite

The best way to get your contribution accepted is to stay
polite
and to follow the guidance of the existing
committers. For the first few contributions it is best to stay with the
current processes and guidelines.
If you
continue to contribute, you will gain more trust and
responsibility
and
you may be able to improve also the
processes
used
by
the
project.

[[contribution_formatting]]
=== Avoid unnecessary formatting changes

Typically open source projects dislike if you re-format unchanged
lines,
as this makes the review process much harder.
Avoid pressing the
_Format source code_
shortcut in your editor. Instead, only select the changes lines and
then press the format source code shortcut (this
is also an
auto-save
preference).

Unnecessary format changes makes it really hard to review a
Gerrit change. The following screenshot shows a file
which was
reformatted, it is unnecessary hard for the reviewer to find the
real
change.

[[contribution_whitespace]]
=== Avoid unnecessary whitespace changes

Typically projects dislike unnecessary whitespace in
the
contributed code. Ensure that you remove trailing
whitespaces from
your contributed code.

Unfortunately lots of project have unnecessary whitespace
included in the source code, most committers also don't
like if you
remove them as it changes the history.

[[contribution_pushunfinished]]
=== Pushing unfinished features

For most projects it is OK to push an initial
(unfinished)
implementation
concept to Gerrit and to ask for
feedback.

Mark unfinished commits with [RFC] (request for comments) or
[WIP] (work in progress) in the commit message
header to avoid
frustrating reviewers who typically want to know if the change is
considered to be ready by the author
or not.

TIP: In general you should develop
in the open as much as possible to
avoid the unpleasant
surprise that your perfect
contribution is
rejected because it does
not fit into the design of
the software.

[[contribution_validuserpassword]]
=== Valid user and email

Some project uses additional validation plug-ins. For example the Eclipse foundation uses a server-side Gerrit
plugin which
checks for
conformity
with
the CLA. When you push a change to Gerrit
this plugin verifies if your
contribution
passes
all the CLA
requirements from the Eclipse
foundation.

This means that
the author field must be a valid Eclipse user. If
the
author is not
a committer it requires that the
author also
"Sign-off" their
contribution. Eclipse Git provides a preference to
always sign-off changes.

See:
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions[Wiki for Git contributions]

[[contribution_nofeedback]]
=== Not getting feedback

If everything works perfectly, the developers of the project you are contributing to will
accept
your contribution
and help you to solve all your open
questions.

If you don't get feedback there are different possible reasons:
maybe all committers are busy or in vacation. Or
your change is
extremely large (hard to review) or it ignores all the rules
explained in the project's contributor
guide.

If your contribution is
ignored, feel
free to ask in
the Bug report
for feedback or to send
email to the
project
mailing
list.

[[contribution_rudefeedback]]
=== Dealing with negative feedback

Don't get
frustrated by negative feedback, as the collaboration
almost
always
results in a better commit that
benefits everyone.
