[[ssh_authentication]]
== Authentication via SSH

=== The concept of SSH
(((SSH key pair)))
Most Git (and Gerrit) servers support SSH based authentication. This
requires a
_SSH key pair_
for
automatic authentication.

An SSH key par consists of a public and private key. The public
key is
uploaded to the application you want to authenticate with. The
application has
no
access
to
the private key. If you interact with
the
hosting
provider via
the
ssh
protocol, the public key is used to
identify
a
user
who encrypted
the
data
during communication with the
corresponding
private key.

[[ssh_keygeneration]]
=== SSH key pair generation

To create an SSH key under Linux (or Windows / Mac with OpenSSH
installed) switch to the command line and
execute
the following
commands.
The generated SSH
key is by default
located in the
`.ssh`
directory of the user home directory. Ensure that you backup existing
keys in
this directory
before running the following commands.

The Eclipse IDE allows you to create an SSH key pair via
menu:Window[Preferences > General > Network Connection > SSH2].

It is good practice to use a
passphrase to protect your
private key. It
is also good practice to
use
operating system level permission settings
to ensure that only
the
owning user can access the
`~/.ssh`
folder and its content.

NOTE: In the above
`ssh-keygen`
command the -C parameter is a comment. Using your email is good
practice so that
someone looking at your public key can contact you
in
case they have
questions. Including the email enables system
administrators
to contact the person in case of questions.

The result will be two files,
`id_rsa`
which is your private key and
`id_rsa.pub`
which is your public key.

You find more details for the generation of an SSH key on the
following
webpages:
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys[GitHub Help: description of SSH key creation]
or
http://www.openssh.com/manual.html[OpenSSH manual].

TIP: You can specify alternative key names with the
`-f`
parameter on the
command line.
This is helpful if you have multiple
different
repositories and you
want to have a different key for each
one. For
example, you can name
your SSH keys in domain
name format,
e.g.,
`eclipse.org`
and
`eclipse.org.pub`
as well as
`github.com`
and
`github.com.pub`.

You need
additional configuration in the
`.ssh/config`
file, because
only
the
`id_rsa`
will be picked up by
default. The following code shows an
example.
