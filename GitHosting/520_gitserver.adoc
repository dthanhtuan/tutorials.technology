[[gitserver]]
== Own Git server

[[gitserver_install]]
=== Hosting your own Git server
(((Git server,configuration)))
As described before, you do not need a server. 
You can just use a file system or a public Git provider, such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
Sometimes, however, it is convenient to have your own server, and installing it under Ubuntu is relatively easy.

First make sure you have installed the SSH tooling.

If you have not yet installed Git on your server, you need to
do
this too.

Create a new user and set a password for the Git system.

Now log in with your Git user and create a bare repository.

include::res/server/repo.txt[]

Now you can push to the remote repository.

[[gitserver_access]]
=== Give write access to a Git repository
(((Git server,write access)))
The typical setup based on the created _git_ user from above is that the public SSH key of each user is added to the
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the _git_ user. 
Afterwards everyone can access the system using the _git_ user.

Alternatively you could use LDAP authentication or other special configurations.

[[gitserver_security]]
=== Security setup for the git user
(((Git server,security)))
(((Git server,git-shell)))
The Git installation provides a specialized shell, which can be assigned to the user. 
Typically this shell is located under in `/usr/bin/git-shell` and can be assigned to the user via the `/etc/passwd` configuration file to the Git user. 
If you assign this shell to the Git user, this user can also perform git commands which add safety to your Git setup.
