== Continuous Integration with Github and Jenkins via Webhooks


You can trigger a `Jenkins` build after each change in on your `GitHub` repository while using Webhooks.

To enable this, navigate to the repository and click on menu:Settings[Webhooks].

Click on `Add webhook`.

The Jenkins Webhook URL or also called Payload URL follows the pattern `<Jenkins url>/github-webhook/`.

Click on `Update webhook`.

Now add the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin[Jenkins GitHub Plugin] to your Jenkins instance.
Make sure you have your Jenkins build correctly configured for the GitHub repository.
Navigate to the Configure page of your Jenkins build.
Under "Build Triggers" choose the option "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".

After your next commit to the repository a new Jenkins build should start automatically.
