== Using Gerrit through GerritHub

http://gerrithub.io[GerritHub] is a service that allows you to use https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gerrit/article.html[Gerrit] for code reviews for your GitHub repositories.
It works by cloning your repositories to it's servers and allows you to push Gerrit changes to them.
Merged Gerrit changes are synced back to GitHub.
Once you have imported a repository to GerritHub it is best to stop pushing to GitHub as GerritHub only syncs in one direction.
You can still push commits directly to the repository on GerritHub without starting a Gerrit change.
Those commits will also be synced back to GitHub.

=== Authorizing GerritHub

To use the service you have to Sign in with your GitHub account.
Open up http://gerrithub.io and press btn:[First time Sign In].

image::gerrithub/gerrithub_first_time_sign_in.png[First time Sign In button] 

On the next page choose btn:[Sign In] to log in with your GitHub account.

image::gerrithub/gerrithub_sign_in.png[Sign In button]

You can then choose if you want to give GerritHub access to your private or only your public repositories.
GerritHub then asks for the following authorizations:

* Read-only access to your email adresses
* Read and write acess to your public (and possibly private) repositories
* Read-only access to your organizations
You have to accept to proceed.

After finalizing your account information you are then ready to use GerritHub.
In the next step you can choose which repositories you want to import and have the possibility to import existing pull requests.

=== Importing a repository from GitHub

To import a repository from GitHub, first open Gerrit on GerritHub: https://review.gerrithub.io.
Now choose menu:GitHub[Repositories].

image::gerrithub/gerrithub_import_repositories_link.png[Import repositories link]

Select all repositories that you want to import and click on the btn:[Next] button.
The next page lets you select which existing pull requests you want to import as Gerrit changes.

=== Importing pull requests from GitHub

It is possible to import existing pull requests from GitHub as Gerrit changes.
Please be aware that changes made to the pull request after the import won't propagate to the Gerrit change.
You can import the pull request again but this will create a new Gerrit change instead of updating the old Gerrit change.

To import pull requests from GitHub open Gerrit on GerritHub: https://review.gerrithub.io.
Now choose menu:GitHub[Pull Requests].

image::gerrithub/gerrithub_import_pull_requests_link.png[Import pull requests link]

Select all pull requests you want to import and then press the btn:[Next] button.

=== Pushing a commit to GerritHub for code review

Once you have imported your GitHub resources into GerritHub you can use it like any other Gerrit instance.
After you merged a change GerritHub will automatically try to push it back to GitHub.
For information on how to use Gerrit please see our https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gerrit/article.html#gerritreview_configuration[Gerrit tutorial].


=== Keeping the repositories in sync

If you are only using GerritHub to push changes you don't have to do anything additional.
GerritHub automatically propagates merged changes back to GitHub.
If you or someone else pushes changes directly to GitHub you have to manually sync this changes to GerritHub.
Assuming you have set GitHub as your `origin` remote and `gerrithub` as your GerritHub remote:

[source, terminal]
----
git pull master
git push gerrithub master
----

=== Build validation with Jenkins

It is possible to trigger a new build by every patch set that gets uploaded to Gerrit.
This way you can be confident that changes submitted through Gerrit won't break your build.
It is recommended to use an extra Jenkins user for Gerrit.

Create a new GitHub user for your Jenkins instance and link it with GerritHub as described in <<authorize_gerrithub>>.
Make sure to add the public ssh key of the Jenkins to this account at https://review.gerrithub.io/#/settings/ssh-keys.

Now give the Jenkins user the rights to change the `Verified` label.
You can do this by editing your https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gerrit/article.html#editing_project_config_git[project configuration file]:

----
[access "refs/*"]
	<other entries...>
	read = group user/<Jenkins User Id>
[access "refs/heads/*"]
	<...>
	label-Verified = -1..+1 group user/<Jenkins User Id>
----

Now install the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger[Gerrit Trigger plugin] onto your Jenkins instance.
The `Gerrit Trigger` plugin works by listening to the Gerrit event stream.
This way the Gerrit server doesn't have to specifically know about the Jenkins server.
It is enough to give the Jenkins user the required access rights to the Jenkins project.
If you want to check out the event stream yourself you can listen to it with this command:

[source, terminal]
----
ssh -p 29418 <your jenkins user>@review.gerrithub.io gerrit stream-events
----

The next step is to add GerritHub to the Gerrit Trigger configuration.
Navigate to menu:Manager Jenkins[Gerrit Trigger] and add a new server:

image::jenkins/jenkins_gerrit_trigger_server_config.png[alt="Hostname: review.gerrithub.io, Frontend URL: https://review.gerrithub.io/, Port: 29418"]

Before saving hit the btn:[Test Connection] button to make sure you entered the right information.

Now you can change your desired project to include a Gerrit trigger.
Open up menu:Project[Configure] and choose "Gerrit event" under "Build triggers".
Select the server that we created earlier from the drop down menu.
For this example we have chosen to name our project "hello_world".
We match on it by adding a project of type "Plain" and writing down the exact project name.
The project name follows the pattern `<jenkins user name>/<project name>`.
To match all branches on the project we choose the type "RegExp" and enter `.*`.
By not adding anything under "Trigger on" we let the plugin add the default triggers "Patch set created" and "Draft published".

image::jenkins/gerrit_trigger_configuration.png[Jenkins Project configuration page with Gerrit Trigger configuration] 

The next step is to configure the Git plugin, so the build job knows which repository to fetch and build.
As "Repository URL" we enter the the GerritHub project url.
It follows the pattern `ssh://<GerritHub jenkins user>@review.gerrithub.io:29418/<project owner user>/<project name>`.
Press the btn:[Advanced] button and enter `$GERRIT_REFSPEC` as "Refspec".
As branch to build enter `$GERRIT_BRANCH`.
Under "Additional Behaviors" add an "Strategy for choosing what to build" entry and choose "Gerrit Trigger" from the drop down menu.

As last step your should add the appropriate build step for your project.

To test your configuration create a new Gerrit change or upload a new patch set to an existing change.
The Jenkins build server should give you feedback now:
