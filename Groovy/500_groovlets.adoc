== Developing Java EE servlets with Groovy - Groovlets

[[groovlets1]]
=== Using Groovy on the server

Java EE defines the servlet API for implementing web
applications. Groovlets are the servlet equivalent for Groovy.

Groovlets, or Groovy Pages, are typically processed by a Groovy
Servlet.

A Groovlet has automatically access to the following information:

* application, context - Gives access to javax.servlet.ServletContext
* session – Gives access to javax.servlet.HttpSession
* request –s Gives access to javax.servlet.HttpServlet
* response –> Gives access to javax.servlet.HttpResponse
* out –> Gives access to response.getWriter()

[[groovlets_downloadgroovy]]
=== Download the groovy-all.jar

To use Groovy on the server you need to deploy Groovy on the
application server or with your application.

The easiest way to download Groovy is via
http://search.maven.org/]]Search Maven]. 
Search here for
`org.codehaus.groovy`
and identify the
`groovy-all`
and download the JAR file of the latest release.

[[groovlets_example]]
=== Exercise: Using Groovy on the server

The following description assume that you are familiar with Java
Web
development, if not see the
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[Java web development tutorial].

Create a new Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse called
`com.vogella.groovy.web.groovelets`.

Add the
`groovy-all.jar`
to the
`WebContent`
folder

Add a file called
`test.groovy`
to the
`WebContent`
folder with the following content. This is a Groovy page using the
Html builder to create a HTML page.

[source,java]
----
include::res/groovlets/test.groovy[]
----

Change the
`WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml`
to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/groovlets/web.xml[]
----

[[groovlets_validate]]
=== Validate that it run on the server

Start your web application and validates that you can access the
Groovlet. Also inspect the source of the HTML and validate that it
really is HTML code.

[[groovlets_extend]]
=== Exercise: Extend your Groovlet

Use some of the implicit available variables, e.g.,
`request`
to display information in your Groovlet.
