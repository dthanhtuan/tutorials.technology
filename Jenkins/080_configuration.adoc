== Configure Jenkins

=== Connect to Jenkins for the initial configuration

After installation, open a browser and connect to it.
The default port of Jenkins is `:8080`, therefore on your local machine you find it under the following URL: 
....
http://localhost:8080/
....

You will need to copy the initial password from the file system of the server.

Afterwards you can select to install plug-ins.
Select the _Install suggested plug-ins_ to get a typical configuration.

Create an admin user and press _Save and Finish_.



=== User management Jenkins
		
Select _Manage Jenkins_ and then _Configure Global Security_. 
Select the _Enable security_ flag. 
The easiest way is to use Jenkins own user database. 
Create at least the user "Anonymous" with read access. 
Also create entries for the users you want to add in the next step.

Navigate to _Manage Roles_ to define access restrictions in detail. 
_Pattern_ is a regex value of the job name.
The following grants unregistered users read-only access to your build jobs that start with the `C-MASTER` or `M-MASTER` prefix and only those.

[[jenkinsconfiguration_ssh]]
=== Generate ssh key for Jenkins user
		
If you want to access a private Git repo, for example at Github, you need to generate an ssh key-pair. 
Create a SSH key with the following command.

[source,console]
----
sudo -u jenkins ssh-keygen
----

The public key must be uploaded to the service you are using, e.g., Github.

=== Configure the default port of the Jenkins build server

[source,console]
----
sudo vim /etc/default/jenkins
----
