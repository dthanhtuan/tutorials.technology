== Build Pipelines

Jenkins pipelines help you align the build process of a project.
This is done by specifying tasks and the order in which they are executed.
There are all kinds of possible tasks that a jenkins pipeline can do for you.
For example, build assets, send an email on error or send the build artifacts via SSH to your application server.

=== Setup using a Jenkinsfile

Jenkins allows to specify pipelines using a `Jenkinsfile`. 
This is just a textfile that contains the necessary data for jenkins to execute the pipeline.
It is called `Jenkinsfile` (notice: no file extension) and should be placed in the root of your project.

NOTE: This file should be checked into version control as it is needed on your Jenkins instance.

Jenkins supports two different syntaxes.

1. Declarative (since Pipeline version 2.5)
2. Scripted

For this tutorial we will focus on the declarative approach.

The following example shows a pipeline with 2 stages:

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
	agent any <1>

	stages {
		stage('Build Assets') {
			agent any <1>
			steps {
				echo 'Building Assets'
			}
		}
		stage('Test') {
			agent any
			steps {
				echo 'Testing stuff...'
			}
		}
	}
}
----
<1> The `agent` directive tells jenkins to allocate a workspace and an executor for the pipeline.
Without it, the pipeline is not valid and therefore required. 

=== Setup using the Blue Ocean plugin

The above process can also be done using the https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean] _Jenkins_ plugin.

==== Installation

To install the plugin go to menu:Manage Jenkins[Manage Plugins>Available] and select the _Blue Ocean_ plugin.

After the installation is finished you have an additional menu entry called btn:[Open Blue Ocean] in your main _Jenkins_ navigation.

==== Creating a new pipeline

Click on btn:[New Pipeline] to create a new pipeline.

Select your version control provider.

NOTE: For this example we will use a github repository

Depending on your provider you will need to pass some kind of credentials.

NOTE: Github provides the ability to generate access-tokens that applications can use to access the platform with your user.
You can also restrict what the acess-token can do.

The _Blue Ocean_ application will provide a link to the GitHub page you need visit.
The necessary permissions that _Blue Ocean_ needs to operate are already selected.
Add a description and click on btn:[Generate Token] at the bottom of the page.

Copy the generated token and paste it in the _Blue Ocean_ mask.

Select the account the repository belongs to and select the repository.

If you already have a `Jenkinsfile` with pipelines in the repository it will show up in the last step.
If not _Blue Ocean_ offers to create one for you.

==== Adding steps to your pipeline

In the next screen you will see a visual representation of your pipeline.
Here you can add or remove steps.

To create a new stage click on btn:[+] in the canvas.
A menu will open on the right that lets you specify a name and what steps you want to perform.

After you have finished editing the pipeline _Blue Ocean_ offers to commit the newly created pipeline to your repository.

Under the hood _Blue Ocean_ only created a valid `Jenkinsfile` for jenkins to use.

After commiting _Jenkins_ will build the project using the newly modified pipelines.
