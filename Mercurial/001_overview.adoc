=== Distributed Version control system

With a distributed version control system you basically do not
have a central code repository but everyone has its own branch. To
can
clone a branch and you always get the full history of the whole
branch
on your system. You commit into your own branch and you can
push your
changes to other repositories and other people can pull from
you.

The main advantages of distributed version control systems are

* Speed: As the whole repository is offline available you can much faster search and compare
* Commits: Everyone can commit to his own branch
