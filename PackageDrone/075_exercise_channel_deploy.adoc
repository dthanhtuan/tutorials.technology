Once a deploy key has been created it can be applied to a _Channel_.

<1> Select Channels Section
<2> Select the previously created channel in the list, e.g., My_first_Channel
<3> Go to _Deploy Keys_

Add the _Deploy Group_, which just has been created

When clicking on the _View Maven settings_ link, the following dialog, containing the maven setup, will appear.

These settings can then be specified in the _pom.xml_ and _settings.xml_ file.

Finally `mvn clean deploy` can be called on a Maven project in order to deploy it to the Package Drone instance.
