=== What is SonarQube

SonarQube (formerly Sonar) is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. 
It provides a server component with a bug dashboard which allows to view and analyze reported problems in your source code.
	
Using SonarQube via Maven or Gradle is very simple and very well described on the SonarQube homepage.
See http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+Source+Code and its links for Maven or Gradle.
