=== Adding entries to the launcher
		
To add new entries to the launcher you can create an `.desktop` file and drag the file on the launcher. 


==== Adding Eclipse to the launcher

To lock Eclipse to the launcher first create an `eclipse.desktop` file for Eclipse. 

In the command-line enter:

[source,console]
----
gedit ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop
----

This file should include the following information:

[source,console]
----
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Eclipse
Comment=Eclipse Integrated Development Environment
Icon= home/vogella/eclipse/icon.xpm
Exec= home/vogella/eclipse/eclipse
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;IDE;Java;
StartupWMClass=Eclipse
----

NOTE: Modify the icon and exec path to the the path where you installed Eclipse.

Now add execution permission to `eclipse.desktop` in the command-line

[source,console]
----
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop
----

Finally you can add Eclipse to the launcher. To achieve this you can either use the command-line and enter 

[source,console]
----
nautilus ~/.local/share/applications
----

select `eclipse.desktop` and drop it on the launcher or you can start Eclipse and then press `Lock to Launcher` on the Eclipse icon in the launcher.

The following example creates an entry to start Eclipse with different shortcuts for different workspaces.
