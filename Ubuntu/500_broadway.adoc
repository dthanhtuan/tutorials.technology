== Broadway

This section describes, how you can display the https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html[Eclipse IDE] or any other GTK+ application in your web browser using the _GDK Broadway_ backend.

=== Start a Broadway server

In order to display Eclipse or any other application in your web browser, you need to start a Broadway server which comes with GTK+.

Simply open a Terminal window and start a Broadway server by typing the following:

[source,terminal]
----
start broadwayd
----

If you want to set a specific port, just append _:offset_.

	start broadwayd :5

The default port is 8080 and as we chose 5 as our offset, the actual port is now 8085.

=== Using Broadway to run a GTK+ application

You can use any GTK3 application, like Eclipse or gedit in the browser. 
This demonstrate how to start such an application.
Start another Terminal window and type the following:

	GDK_BACKEND=broadway gedit 

If you started your Broadway server with a specific port offset (e.g. to use 8085 as a port), use the following command:

	GDK_BACKEND=broadway BROADWAY_DISPLAY=:5 gedit

You can now open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080] (or 8085) and see your application running.

=== Starting Eclipse

[source,terminal]
----
GDK_BACKEND=broadway BROADWAY_DISPLAY=:5 java -jar ./plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.4.0.v20161219-1356.jar
----

=== Using Broadway to start a runtime Eclipse from the Eclipse IDE

Make sure, that you use _Eclipse Neon_ or above.
To now display Eclipse in your web browser, open Eclipse itself.
Eclipse has the ability to start itself with the help of a new run configuration.
To create one, click on the small black arrow next to the _Run_ button `image:broadway_runconfigurations.png[]` and select _Run Configurations..._.
On the left side of the newly opened window make a right-click on _Eclipse Application_ and select _New_.
Open the _Environment_ tab and create two new environment variables like the following:

image::broadway_environment.png[]

If you started your Broadway server with a port offset, just replace _:0_ with your selected offset.
You can now open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (or 8085) and see Eclipse running.
