=== XSLT transformations with Eclipse

This chapter explains how to use the Eclipse tooling to do your XLS transformation.

Create a new project of type _General_ in Eclipse called _de.vogella.xslt.first_. 
Create a folder `files`.

Create the following XML file `source.xml` in the folder `files`.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/source.xml[]

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/transform.xsl[]
